    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper aboout sparsity that will contribute significantly to the field.",
    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, which studies the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks by training multiple small Transformer models on multiple datasets of mathematical operations. Please come up with interesting experiments which combine multiple aspects of grokking and compositional sparsity to investigate this phenomenon. Compositional sparsity refers to the tendency of neural networks to develop sparse internal representations, particularly in scenarios requiring generalization."
