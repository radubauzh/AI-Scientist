    "Title": "Dynamic Sparsity and Grokking: The Interplay Between Sparse Masks and Generalization",
    "Experiment": "Combine sparse training techniques (e.g., dynamic sparse reparameterization or lottery ticket hypotheses) with settings that exhibit grokking. Test whether dynamically adjusting sparsity throughout training accelerates the grokking transition or alters the optimization trajectories. Measure whether sparsity evolution correlates with the model's ability to generalize and identify any patterns that emerge during the grokking phase.",
